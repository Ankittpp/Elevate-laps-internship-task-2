My Work Summary
  
I analyzed 500 customer orders across 336 unique customers to understand overall performance.

I tracked ₹437K in total sales and ₹37K in profit, giving a clear view of the business’s financial health.

I broke down performance by categories:

Electronics contributed the most sales (₹166K),

Clothing performed strongly (₹144K),

Furniture followed (₹127K).

I assessed payment behavior, finding that Cash on Delivery (COD) was the most used option, followed by UPI and cards.

I identified the top-performing cities — Indore, Mumbai, and Pune — as major contributors to revenue.

Through this work, I provided a front-view analysis that highlights key KPIs, customer behavior, category performance, and geographic insights, which can guide business decisions.
